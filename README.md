# Next.js SSR Starter Template

This is the boilerplate code generated directly from running `npx create-next-app`. Utilize this template to harness [Fleek’s](https://fleek.xyz/) optimized hosting for dynamic and performance-driven web applications

## Prerequisites

- Node 18.18.0+
- Fleek Account
- [Fleek CLI](https://fleek.xyz/docs/cli/)
- [Fleek Next Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleek-platform/next)

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository by running the following command:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/><your-id>/nextjs-ssr-template.git
```

3. Enter the correct directory, install dependencies, and run locally:

```bash
cd nextjs-ssr-template
npm i
npm run dev
```

4. Ensure that you install the Fleek CLI and the Fleek Next Adapter:

```bash
// local installation
npm i @fleek-platform/cli
npm i @fleek-platform/next

// global installation
npm i -g @fleek-platform/cli
npm i -g @fleek-platform/next

```

💡: you can check the Fleek CLI version by running fleek -v. Any version >= 2.10.1 should be good. As for the Fleek Next adapter, you can check the Fleek Next Adapter version by running fleek-next -v. Any version >= 2.1.0 should be good.

## Building and Deploying

1. Build the project using the Fleek Next Adapter:

```bash
npx fleek-next build
# or if installed globally
fleek-next build
```

2. Now, Create the Fleek Function using the Fleek CLI:

```bash
//syntax
fleek functions create --name '<name of your function>'

//example
fleek functions create --name nextra-function

```

3. Finally, deploy using the Fleek CLI:

```bash
//syntax
fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path .fleek/dist/index.js --assets .fleek/static --name '<name of your function>'

//example
fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path .fleek/dist/index.js --assets .fleek/static --name nextra-function
```
